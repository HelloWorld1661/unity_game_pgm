Similar to a project done at MIT (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/112380999/), our idea is basically a platformer game where you gain points by solving math problems. We differ in that instead of solving Math problems by going on passage towards the correct answers, you collect “Answer Coins”—coins with possible problem answers displayed on them. Collect the correct one, you gain points. Collect the wrong one, you make the problem more complicated or get your points reduced. The goal of the game is to answer as many math problems as quickly as possible. There is a time limit and time bonus.  The goal of the game is to teach math (mostly arithmetic in this game). The motivation to play the game would be to practice basic math problem solving while having fun. The setting of the game can be anything; for simplicity sake, we will make a generic grass and sky background.  Constraints: There will be a time limit, forcing the player to go through the level. The player can only move forwards, backwards, up, and down. No special movements or double jumps.

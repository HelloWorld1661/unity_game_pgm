Parallaxing and Tiling scripts enhance the game's background movement.
Parallaxing creates a sudo 3D-Depth effect.
Tiling automatically extends background / foreground so Player in platformer can keep moving without abrupt bg changes.  It smooths the seams.

 * NOTE for tiling script to work correctly:
 * 		set size of sprite with pixel-density
 * 		instead of scaling w/ the tranform tool
 * 		(default = 100 use smaller vals to make larger)
